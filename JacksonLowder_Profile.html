            <h6 class="column title text-1">Values and Beliefs</h6>
            <p class="text-1">I believe that everyone, student, and teacher have equal rights. If someone has a different opinion than another, those opinions should be taken with equal respect no matter what the position is of the teacher or the student. Some people don't feel comfortable sharing personal information to a public website, and I happen to be one of those people. I believe that my beliefs as well as your beliefs should be equally respected. </p>

            <h6 class="title text-1">Career Aspirations!</h6>
            <p class="text-1">My dream job after college would be working for one of the many companies that I have interned with already. One of them which I will keep un-named for personal reasons has shown me a very fun, educational, and strong working environment, that has a really good team of individuals I have already gained experience with. I would love to work for this company again, and already plan on accepting a second internship there this coming summer before my last semester at Bradley. I worked there as an Engineer in quality control, I got to work directly with manufactorers and part quality control engineers to ensure products this company were producing were following proper standings. </p>

Game design became a new hobby for me around a year ago, and I have gotten really heavily introduced to interesting design as well as understanding Unreal Engine 4, and I am very excited to learn Unreal Engine 5.</p>
